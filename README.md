 GreenShop â€“ Online Flower Store

GreenShop is a modern e-commerce web application for a flower shop, built using Next.js for server-side rendering and fast performance. I integrated Supabase for real-time data management and Clerk for secure user authentication and account management. State handling is managed with Redux Toolkit to ensure smooth and scalable user interactions. The platform includes key e-commerce features like product listing, shopping cart, user authentication, and admin panel for product management.
